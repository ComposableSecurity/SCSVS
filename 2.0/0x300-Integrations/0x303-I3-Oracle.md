# I3: Oracle

## Control Objective

If a project integrates with external Oracle smart contracts, it is necessary to approach them with limited trust and check that they do not introduce unexpected behavior into our system.

Ensure that a verified contract satisfies the following high-level requirements:
* Contract follows a tested and stable Oracle standard,
* The values transferred are additionally verified,
* Vulnerabilities identified in various Oracle implementations have been taken into account during implementation.

Category “I3” lists requirements related to the Oracle smart contract as one of the components with which the project integrates.

## Security Verification Requirements

| # | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **I3.1** | Verify that, when using Uniswap TWAP as a price oracle, the period is long enough to make its manipulation unprofitable for the attacker (compared to the funds at potential risk). |
| **I3.2** | Verify that Oracle data is up-to-date. |
| **I3.3** | Verify that no spot oracle is used (e.g. spot price from Uniswap pool). |
| **I3.4** | Verify that, when using Uniswap V3 TWAP as price oracle, liquidity is high enough and is distributed widely across most of the price range. |
| **I3.5** | Verify that, the use a decentralized off-chain oracles unsusceptible to on-chain price manipulation attacks (e.g. Chainlink) is considered for low liquidity asset, ideally combining it with on-chain oracles to detect malicious values. |
| **I3.6** | Verify that the value you are using has had enough time to be reported as invalid and has not been. |
| **I3.7** | Verify that there is a check for stale prices when using Chainlink Oracle |
| **I3.8** | Verify that there is a check for down L2 sequencer when using Chainlink Oracle.  |
| **I3.9** | Verify that NOT the same heartbeat is used for multiple price feeds when using Chainlink Oracle |
| **I3.10** | Verify that the code deals with different price feeds having different decimal precision when using Chainlink Oracle  |
| **I3.11** | Verify that the price feed address wherever it is located(hardcoded, deployment script) is pointing to the correct oracle price feed |
| **I3.12** | Verify that the code handles calls to the oracle if they potentially revert when using Chainlink Oracle |
| **I3.13** | Verify that the code handles the situation when oracle returns incorrect price during flash crashes when using Chainlink Oracle |
