# G1: Architecture, design and threat modeling

## Control Objective

Architecture, design and threat modeling in the context of creating secure smart contracts.
Consider all possible threats before the implementation of the smart contract.

Ensure that a verified contract satisfies the following high-level requirements:
* All related smart contracts are identified and used properly,
* Specific smart contracts security assumptions are considered during the design phase.

Category “G1” lists requirements related to the architecture, design and threat modeling of the smart contracts.

## Security Verification Requirements

| # | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **G1.1** | Verify that every introduced design change is preceded by an earlier threat modeling. |
| **G1.2** | Verify that the documentation clearly and precisely defines all trust boundaries in the contract (trusted relations with other contracts and significant data flows).  |
| **G1.3** | Verify that the SCSVS, security requirements or policy is available to all developers and testers. |
| **G1.4** | Verify that the events for the (state changing/crucial for business) operations are defined. |
| **G1.5** | Verify that there exists a mechanism that can temporarily stop the sensitive functionalities of the contract in case of a new attack. This mechanism should not block access to the assets (e.g. tokens) for their owners. |
| **G1.6** | Verify that the amount of unused cryptocurrencies kept on the contract is controlled and at the minimum acceptable level so as not to become a potential target of an attack. |
| **G1.7** | Verify that if fallback function can be called by anyone, it is included in the threat modeling. |
| **G1.8** | Verify that the business logic in contracts is consistent. Important changes in the logic should be allowed for all or none contract. |
| **G1.9** | Verify that code analysis tools are in use that can detect potentially malicious code. |
| **G1.10** | Verify that the latest version of Solidity release is used. |
| **G1.11** | Verify that, when using the external implementation of contract, you use the current version which has not been superseded. |
| **G1.12** | Verify that when functions are overridden to extend functionality, the super keyword is used to maintain functionality. |
| **G1.13** | Verify that the order of inheritance is carefully specified. |
| **G1.14** | Verify that there is a component that monitors contract activity using events. |
| **G1.15** | Verify that the threat model includes whale transactions. |
| **G1.16** | Verify that the leakage of one person's private key does not compromise the security of the entire project. |
